# restaurant-management-system
An example of a digital content platform that I created to reinforce the structures I learned in an object-oriented programming applications course at university. I do CRUD operations during login and registration and use MD5 encryption algorithm; I also preferred MySQL as database. Don't be eclipsed as an IDE.
