# restaurant-management-system
A project that I developed to reinforce the structures on JavaFX that I learned in the object-oriented programming applications course at university. I used MD5 encryption algorithm for Login and Register operations; I preferred MySQL as database; I also used Eclipse as the IDE.

Structures required for installation and execute:

Eclipse IDE
Java SE 17
MySQL Connector 8.0.29
JavaFX SDK 18.0.1
For Database: AMPPS
Run Configuration - Arguments: --module-path "C:\Users\furkan\jdk\javafx-sdk-18.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
After //--module-path you need to point the path of lib folder of sdk 18.0.1.
